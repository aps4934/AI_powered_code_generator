# AI Code Generator Project TODO

## Completed Steps
- [x] Create backend/generator.py - Updated to use Google Gemini API for AI-powered code generation with language support
- [x] Create backend/app.py - Flask app with /generate endpoint, static file serving, and CORS support
- [x] Create backend/requirements.txt - Updated with Google Generative AI and Flask-CORS dependencies
- [x] Create frontend/index.html - Landing page with project information, features, requirements, libraries, and how it works
- [x] Create frontend/generator.html - Code generator interface with language selector
- [x] Create frontend/style.css - Modern styling with animations and responsive design for both pages
- [x] Create frontend/script.js - Enhanced JavaScript with loading states, copy functionality, and error handling
- [x] Create run.py - Script to start the backend server
- [x] Fix static file serving - Added routes for CSS and JS files
- [x] Improve frontend design - Modern UI with better user experience
- [x] Add language selection feature - Dropdown with 16+ programming languages
- [x] Update backend to handle language parameter - Generate code in specified language
- [x] Create navigation system - Landing page with button to generator, back button from generator to home
- [x] Add comprehensive project information - Requirements, libraries used, and working explanation

## Remaining Steps
- [x] Install dependencies (pip install -r backend/requirements.txt)
- [x] Test the application (start server and verify AI-powered code generation)
- [x] Perform testing (critical-path or thorough as per user preference)
- [x] Test AI generation endpoint (verified working with factorial example)
- [x] Test sum of two numbers generation (now working with improved frontend)
- [x] Test language selection feature (generate code in different languages)
- [x] Test navigation between landing page and generator page
